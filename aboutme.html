<h1>About Ideal</h1>

<p>I am Ideal Mustafa, a 17 year old who lives in Zujince (a village in the municipality of Presevo). I am currently a student in high school "Skenderbeu". </p>
<h2>My hobbies</h2>
<p>I'd say I am a person which loves every activity, as a matter of fact I just don't like passiveness. Being lazy is a choice you don't have to take in my opinion. Everyday is a chance to develop your hobbies, to try something new. Below, you can see some of my best hobbies which I very much enjoy!</p>
    <ul>
        <h3>
            <li>Football</li>
        </h3>
        <p>Football is my life, it's that simple i guess. When playing football, you forget all of your plans, unfinished work, stress and much more information that you fill your mind with unnecesarily. I have played semi-pro football at K.F Lugina for 2 years. Now, i just enjoy playing the beautiful game with my friends.</p>

        <h3>
            <li>Skiing</li>
        </h3>
        <p>Believe it or not, I didn't ski until I was 15 years old. Since then, skiing has been a part of me and I can't wait for the winter season every year!</p>
